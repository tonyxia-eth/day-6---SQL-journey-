# CS50 DESE SQL Assessment â€“ Day 5

## ðŸ“¦ About the Project

This project is part of Harvard's CS50 SQL course, focused on real-world data analysis using SQLite. The data comes from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) in Massachusetts.

The task involved writing 13 SQL queries to analyze school, district, graduation, and spending data â€” all while using the terminal and SQLite to interact with a `.db` file directly.

## âœ… What I Learned

- Navigating folders and files in a UNIX environment using:
  - `ls`, `cd`, `.exit`, and `find`
- Accessing SQLite databases via terminal
- Running queries directly and redirecting output to files using:
  - `sqlite3 database.db "QUERY" > results.txt`
- Writing clean, modular SQL for:
  - Filtering with `WHERE`
  - Grouping with `GROUP BY`
  - Aggregates: `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `COUNT()`
  - Sorting with `ORDER BY`, limiting with `LIMIT`
  - Joining multiple tables for deeper insights
- Debugging case-sensitive filters and typos with `DISTINCT`
- Saving and running `.sql` scripts using `.read` and VS Code

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `1.sql` through `13.sql`: Solution files for each prompt
- `results.txt`: Outputs from some key queries
- `dese.db`: The SQLite database used for analysis

## ðŸš€ Status

**âœ… Completed all 13 tasks**  
This marks Day 5 of my SQL learning journey â€” and I'm already confident working with real-world data using SQL and the terminal.

## ðŸŒ± Next Steps

- Share this milestone on LinkedIn
- Begin building small projects on GitHub using public datasets
- Learn how to visualize SQL results with Python or Tableau
